0,the best poduct that i bought from flifkart it works superb like ac and price is also reasonable only rs 8698,5
1,cooler is big and wide maharaja brand trust y every thing is good about cooler create less noise only thing is that its motor is not powerful even in high speed rest all things are good but yes for one middle size room it is ok,4
2,it is one of the best air coolers at reasonable price have ever seen but the ventilation of the room is must for proper cooling but the size is quite big it will i hope create a space problem during off seasons the air supply is very good and its one of the essential part of the air cooler with the wool wood pads which helps to make super cooling afterall thank you maharaja company to make such a product in affordable and reasonable price,5

5,very nice cooler cooling is very good there is no noise i reviewed a lot then only i purchased it if you want effective cooling you have to set it up at a window where there is cross ventilation without cross ventilation it will make environment humid lookwise it is very nice and material is strong,5

521,writing after using this air cooler for more than a week pros1 best pricing compared to other coolers with overall same specifications2 the body looks durable and attractive3 less energy consumptioncons 1 the motor doesnt feel that powerful2 makes more noise compared to my old symphony jumbo 70 lconclusion according to me if someone is looking for a branded plastic body cooler with an overall nice performance and also in range of 7k they must go for it,4

532,cooling is ok fan speed is good must buy if u want best cooler in summer fantastic delivery too,5
533,cooler is good for a big roomonly thing that i didnt liked is the the inlet given for putting water manually inside the tankthis cooler is only feasible if you can buy a inlet pipe which should be used to fill the tank by connecting it with tapso for all the buyers please keep that thing in mind before buying it because that point is not mentioned anywhere in the descriptionfan speed cooling capacity and rest of the features are excellent,5
534,i got 7199 best in segment,5
